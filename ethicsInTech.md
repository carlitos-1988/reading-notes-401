## Ethics in the Workplace

The code I’m still ashamed of

- This article was an interesting read for the reason that as developers we need to know what to do with the products we place in to the world. I did not fully grasp the potential impacts software can have. Although I am older and feel like I am more mature than a 19 year old the fact of the matter is that there may be times that the code out out there may not be ethical in matters that I do not clearly see and being able to fully understand the scope of this will be crucial to not letting myself fall in to a similar pitfall as the author in the story. 

## Ethics in Technology

Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?

- For this article it does not seem quite right to choose one over the other. It is fair to think that a situation like this would arise and that technology may have to choose one day but in all fairness technology has been allowed to run the way we have allowed it to run. Many people have been killed by machines that have been placed to make our lives easier and I don't think that we cared so much for how this new technology would be safe. We only care because we begin to treat ai as a 'living thing' and therefore we begin to add some sort regulations to it. If it where up to me I would ensure that the technology of self driving cars do not use speed limits as a general guideline and exercise extreme caution when dealing with tough situations. The last resort mentioned in this article would then default to inflicting as much damage to the vehicle with the last resort to inflict damage to the driver. At no point those who are not part of the closed loop should be impacted as they do not belong to the AI,car,driver loop.
