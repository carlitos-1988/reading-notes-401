### Career: Class 20: Partner Power Hour - Report #4

- Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

  - One way that the speaker wil change how I approach my career transition is in the manner in which tone is set in the messages I send out. Understating the impact of tone
  - Aside from tone it is also important to be clear on what is needed from the conversation. When I decide to go though interviews I will constantly ensure that I understand what the interviewer needs from me and what I need from them.

- List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

  - Facial expressions, non verbal and verbal communication. The eyebrow example was interesting to hear and how we can say allot with a simple eyebrow raise.
  - Another important things to understand how our communication approach is based on the relationship type we have with the other person.
  - Pausing and making sure that the response we give is one that is not reactive.

- Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.

Questions

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
  - From what I can understand is that Android tries to split up services provided by either code internal functions to tbe used across applications. If there is code that does not have to be written again then there is no need to write it again and instead call on a service that allows fo the developer to use as needed. Another thing is to use the concept of least privileged and ensure that services and processes are running what they need to run without having access to the other VMs that exist within the phone.
- Describe an Activity in your own word
  - Activity is more so like the traditional front end of a website. There is an activity for login, interacting, and saving to the local database much like web pages do to a traditional website

Questions
What is a technology you’ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

- With shared preferences both node and Java seem similar in how the .env file and the .properties file are used. Seems like they are heavily used in android and the preferred language is xml.
  
- Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

- Quality of the product can be done during development of the application 
- It is easy to add new features based on testable code
- You are able to determine the outputs of the code and understand how the application is utilizing dtata
- Ensures that the application is meeting the intent it was set out for

The most important reason for me is the addition of new fetures while code is being generated. While I do care for a quality product I find it important to be able to continue to build the application on know good software to build off of. If testing is done early and routinely then quality and effectiveness should take care of itself in the end. This does not mean these things are not checked. 

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- From what I understood the back stack is an implementation of a call stack that keeps track of activities in the app. The back stack is able to differentiate between activities happening inside activities and pop that internal activity while keeping the entire back stack intact. Essentially first in last out situation. I did not understand the synthetic call and   about the remaining 60% of the video. 


### Career: Class 27: Workshop #4 Prep - Winning the Interview


- One of the biggest things that I did not think about in the past about interviewing for the position was to try the product or service that they offer. It interesting to see how one could be able to see the service being offered and how one would be able to create value for that organization based on current skills and potential fit within the organization. Based on the product or offering for the job I would identify my best attributes and skills I have for the job currently. By identifying what skills and attributes are valued by the organization I would be able to best prepare myself for the interview. ANother important aspect that I will prepare myself for is salary negotiations. Understanding what I will currently leave an organization for and what I expect for my salary to be is important for the reason that I do not want to sell myself short and do not want to be underpaid for a position that an organization is willing to pay allot for. Lastly and importantly is to hone in my technical skills for the job I am applying for. If I would apply to a front end engineer job then I would undoubtedly brush up on front end technologies while setting backend technologies to the side. it will all be a matter of perspective and situation for what technologies I brush up and ensure that I am ready to now only perform in the technical side of the interview but also be able to speak intelligently around the technologies being interviewed for.

Questions

- What is a technology you’ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

  - in spring the best way I can relate this technology is by the use of Principal p and the session. Although not entirely the same I can see how there is only one Shared Preferences instance per device and application to be used to persist data across the app. 
  
- Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

  - Sane reasons as before to be able to test inputs and outputs of the functions of the application 
  - To test for application behavior and expectations of what is to occur in the application 
  - To verify that a piece of code is able to be tested on pass tests and built on top of. Not being able to test and building on top of that code can be dangerous behavior in the event that the codebase is not able to be built on. 

- Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- One of the best analogies that comes to mind is the used of the call stack. while the user is able to move from one page to another those pages/activities are pushed on to the back stack and by pressing the back button the top of the stack is pushed off and the old state is returned like the user never left that part of the page.
