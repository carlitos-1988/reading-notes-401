### Career: Class 20: Partner Power Hour - Report #4

- Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

  - One way that the speaker wil change how I approach my career transition is in the manner in which tone is set in the messages I send out. Understating the impact of tone
  - Aside from tone it is also important to be clear on what is needed from the conversation. When I decide to go though interviews I will constantly ensure that I understand what the interviewer needs from me and what I need from them.

- List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

  - Facial expressions, non verbal and verbal communication. The eyebrow example was interesting to hear and how we can say allot with a simple eyebrow raise.
  - Another important things to understand how our communication approach is based on the relationship type we have with the other person.
  - Pausing and making sure that the response we give is one that is not reactive.

- Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.

Questions

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
  - From what I can understand is that Android tries to split up services provided by either code internal functions to tbe used across applications. If there is code that does not have to be written again then there is no need to write it again and instead call on a service that allows fo the developer to use as needed. Another thing is to use the concept of least privileged and ensure that services and processes are running what they need to run without having access to the other VMs that exist within the phone.
- Describe an Activity in your own word
  - Activity is more so like the traditional front end of a website. There is an activity for login, interacting, and saving to the local database much like web pages do to a traditional website

Questions
What is a technology you’ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

- With shared preferences both node and Java seem similar in how the .env file and the .properties file are used. Seems like they are heavily used in android and the preferred language is xml.
- Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

- Quality of the product can be done during development of the application
- It is easy to add new features based on testable code
- You are able to determine the outputs of the code and understand how the application is utilizing dtata
- Ensures that the application is meeting the intent it was set out for

The most important reason for me is the addition of new fetures while code is being generated. While I do care for a quality product I find it important to be able to continue to build the application on know good software to build off of. If testing is done early and routinely then quality and effectiveness should take care of itself in the end. This does not mean these things are not checked.

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- From what I understood the back stack is an implementation of a call stack that keeps track of activities in the app. The back stack is able to differentiate between activities happening inside activities and pop that internal activity while keeping the entire back stack intact. Essentially first in last out situation. I did not understand the synthetic call and about the remaining 60% of the video.

### Career: Class 27: Workshop #4 Prep - Winning the Interview

- One of the biggest things that I did not think about in the past about interviewing for the position was to try the product or service that they offer. It interesting to see how one could be able to see the service being offered and how one would be able to create value for that organization based on current skills and potential fit within the organization. Based on the product or offering for the job I would identify my best attributes and skills I have for the job currently. By identifying what skills and attributes are valued by the organization I would be able to best prepare myself for the interview. ANother important aspect that I will prepare myself for is salary negotiations. Understanding what I will currently leave an organization for and what I expect for my salary to be is important for the reason that I do not want to sell myself short and do not want to be underpaid for a position that an organization is willing to pay allot for. Lastly and importantly is to hone in my technical skills for the job I am applying for. If I would apply to a front end engineer job then I would undoubtedly brush up on front end technologies while setting backend technologies to the side. it will all be a matter of perspective and situation for what technologies I brush up and ensure that I am ready to now only perform in the technical side of the interview but also be able to speak intelligently around the technologies being interviewed for.

Questions

- What is a technology you’ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

  - in spring the best way I can relate this technology is by the use of Principal p and the session. Although not entirely the same I can see how there is only one Shared Preferences instance per device and application to be used to persist data across the app.

- Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

  - Sane reasons as before to be able to test inputs and outputs of the functions of the application
  - To test for application behavior and expectations of what is to occur in the application
  - To verify that a piece of code is able to be tested on pass tests and built on top of. Not being able to test and building on top of that code can be dangerous behavior in the event that the codebase is not able to be built on.

- Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- One of the best analogies that comes to mind is the used of the call stack. while the user is able to move from one page to another those pages/activities are pushed on to the back stack and by pressing the back button the top of the stack is pushed off and the old state is returned like the user never left that part of the page.

Questions

What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?

- Room is wrapped around SQL Lite. It would be a good choice to use since it is set up to work with SQL lite and has additional features to work with Android development such as:
  - Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
  - Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
  - Streamlined database migration paths.

Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?

- Usage seems similar to JPA by connecting the application context to the class being used in the application.

Describe a DAO in your own words

- A DAO is similar to the way we created entities in spring with the exception that they are more so used as interfaces so allot of the methods could be built in.

### Career: Class 30: Partner Power Hour - Report #6

Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- There is always more to know. Even when you think you understand tooling theres allot to understand. This being said, I am not sure when anytime soon I will be working with javascript but it is good to see how allot of the built in tools of chrome work together to be able to modify existing code.

List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

- One key takeaway was the use of a debugger and insert conditional breakpoints in the already exiting code. I wonder if this is something that I could implement in java. Knowing this I will also increase my knowledge in debugging so that I better understand how my program runs and behaves when I am trying to fix it.

Questions
What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?

- Github: with using github and its tools you do get to learn the tools and services provided by github since you are interacting with them in a more direct manner. With amplify you only deal with the interface but do not get to learn AWS.
- Heroku: same as github there is more to learn about the service how it works and how to get it to work with your application. It also allows you to use any technology you want since it is not tied to one particular provider.

What AWS Region is closest to you?
Seattle, US
Zone Name: us-west-2-sea-1a
Parent Region: US West (Oregon)

Questions
What makes an API RESTful?

- An API is RESTful when two computers are able to communicate in a secure, reliable, and efficient manner.

What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

- One benefit of GraphQL is its ability to pick and choose only the fields that you want to retrieve from the DB. This makes GraphQL faster.
- Another benefit is the ability to define the data shape returned

Disadvantages:

- Queries can be overly complex
- There is rate limiting for daily requests

Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

- meaning that it is not your computer that is being used. The service i.e. web, storage, mail or anything is being hosted by someone else and all you have to do is understand how the api work in order to be able to interact with the serverless service. 


### Career: Class 35: Partner Power Hour - Report #7

Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

One of the biggest things I will take away from this is to begin to learn GitHub actions. understanding that this is one part of the CICD pipeline it is important to begin to work with the tools that provide continuous integration


List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

I have dealt with CICD in the past with my current job. Although I did not have direct actions with this I understand it better now and how important it is when dealing with people who consume your application. Also what it means to a company when it is in the business of providing a service based on software. I also will always ensure that I get with as many experts with respect to security and any other experts.

No LinkedIn connection sent speaker mentioned that she does not do linked in and only really does twitter I don't have twitter.


### Hash Tables 

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

 hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

 Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. 

 Hash maps take advantage of an array’s O(1) read access. Instead of adding elements to an array from beginning to end, a hash map uses a “hash function” to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.

 Basically, the hash function takes a key and returns an integer. We use the integer to determine where the key/value pair should be placed in the array. The hash code is calculated in constant time and writing to an array at one index is O(1) so the hash map has O(1) access.

Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

creating a Hash
Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
Insert into the array at that index

NOTE : Production systems will have much more robust hashing algorithms that ensure even distribution of values across all buckets and avoid unnecessary collision

Each index of the array can hold many types of values. The trick is how the values are stored in comparison to efficiency. Each Index of the array contain “buckets”. Each of these “buckets” holds one key/value pair combination. When there is no entry in a specific bucket, the buckets (each index of the array) all start null. The hash table starts each bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates a hashCode that corresponds with an index.

Since different keys can lead to the same bucket it’s important to store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, not just the value. The key must be stored with the value! If only values were stored in buckets then it would be impossible to determine which value to return when a key led you to a bucket.

### Read Class 36

Amplify and Cognito (read “Getting started” and “Sign in” subsections)

Where in your application should you check the current auth session?

- Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession

what is the command that is used to push your changes to the cloud?

-amplify push

What does Amplify Auth do for your application?

- helps you create and configure the auth category with an authentication provider in our case we will use cognito.
