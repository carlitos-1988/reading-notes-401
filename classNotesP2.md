Questions

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
  - From what I can understand is that Android tries to split up services provided by either code internal functions to tbe used across applications. If there is code that does not have to be written again then there is no need to write it again and instead call on a service that allows fo the developer to use as needed. Another thing is to use the concept of least privileged and ensure that services and processes are running what they need to run without having access to the other VMs that exist within the phone. 
- Describe an Activity in your own word
  - Activity is more so like the traditional front end of a website. There is an activity for login, interacting, and saving to the local database much like web pages do to a traditional website
