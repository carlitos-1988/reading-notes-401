### Career: Class 20: Partner Power Hour - Report #4

- Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

  - One way that the speaker wil change how I approach my career transition is in the manner in which tone is set in the messages I send out. Understating the impact of tone
  - Aside from tone it is also important to be clear on what is needed from the conversation. When I decide to go though interviews I will constantly ensure that I understand what the interviewer needs from me and what I need from them.

- List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

  - Facial expressions, non verbal and verbal communication. The eyebrow example was interesting to hear and how we can say allot with a simple eyebrow raise.
  - Another important things to understand how our communication approach is based on the relationship type we have with the other person.
  - Pausing and making sure that the response we give is one that is not reactive.

Questions

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
  - From what I can understand is that Android tries to split up services provided by either code internal functions to tbe used across applications. If there is code that does not have to be written again then there is no need to write it again and instead call on a service that allows fo the developer to use as needed. Another thing is to use the concept of least privileged and ensure that services and processes are running what they need to run without having access to the other VMs that exist within the phone.
- Describe an Activity in your own word
  - Activity is more so like the traditional front end of a website. There is an activity for login, interacting, and saving to the local database much like web pages do to a traditional website

Questions
What is a technology you’ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

- With shared preferences both node and Java seem similar in how the .env file and the .properties file are used. Seems like they are heavily used in android and the preferred language is xml.
  
- Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

- Quality of the product can be done during development of the application 
- It is easy to add new features based on testable code
- You are able to determine the outputs of the code and understand how the application is utilizing dtata
- Ensures that the application is meeting the intent it was set out for

The most important reason for me is the addition of new fetures while code is being generated. While I do care for a quality product I find it important to be able to continue to build the application on know good software to build off of. If testing is done early and routinely then quality and effectiveness should take care of itself in the end. This does not mean these things are not checked. 

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- From what I understood the back stack is an implementation of a call stack that keeps track of activities in the app. The back stack is able to differentiate between activities happening inside activities and pop that internal activity while keeping the entire back stack intact. Essentially first in last out situation. I did not understand the synthetic call and   about the remaining 60% of the video.
